      Thanks for visiting our site.
      <br />
      The Higher-Ed Exchange consulting agency is your premier guide through the
      myriad priceless higher education opportunities of the USA. East African
      middle class families who know the value of a world-class education have
      long sought education in the UK and Europe, South Africa, India, among
      other nations.
      <br />
      But for a number of reasons, the US higher education system has mystified
      and discouraged numerous families from pursuing their dream of a quality
      university education.
      <br />
      That’s where we come in. Via this site, meetings with the HigherEdExchange
      East African regional director, and correspondence with the US-based chief
      consultant, parents and students will be taken step-by-step through the
      process of researching, applying to, and succeeding in American colleges*
      and universities.

      <br />
      In the USA, the word “college” denotes a university. Many colleges are of
      a smaller size compared to bigger universities, but their academic ranking
      is often the same, or higher. These institutions also often confer
      advanced (Masters and Doctorate) degrees.
